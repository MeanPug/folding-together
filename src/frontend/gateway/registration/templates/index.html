    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-lg">
        Though it isn't new, the <a href="https://foldingathome.org/" class="content-link">Folding@Home project</a> allows individuals to donate their computing
        resources to researchers searching for cures to diseases like Covid-19.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">
        These resources allow researchers to run computationally expensive simulations that illustrate how atoms
        in a protein move relative to each other, allowing for therapeutic discoveries. Let's help find a cure, together.
